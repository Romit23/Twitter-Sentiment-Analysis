Scenario: By analyzing text data, we can find meaningful insights from non-numeric data that can help us achieve our objective. With the help of NLP and its concepts, we can do it. Twitter is one of the biggest platforms that people use to write their messages, express their feelings about a particular topic, and share knowledge in the form of text. By analyzing text data, we can make good decisions for different use cases like judging the sentiment of the human tweets, and any product review/comments can tell us the performance of a product in the market.NLP allows us to study and understand the colinearity of the data. So we can predict our objective. 

Objective: Use Python libraries such as Pandas for data operations, Seabornand Matplotlibfor data visualization and EDA tasks, NLTK to extract and analyze the information, and Sklearn for model building and performance visualization, to predict our different categories of peopleâ€™s mindsets.

Dataset description: The data contains information about many tweets in the form of text and their types, as mentioned below.

Tweets: Data is in the form of a sentence written by individuals.

category:  Numeric(0: Neutral, -1: Negative, 1: Positive)(It is our dependent variable)
